## Assignment 
This assignment is a web application built using Next.js and Node.js, both written in TypeScript. The project is organized into two folders: client and server.

### client
- The client folder contains the Next.js application, which handles the front-end part of the application. It utilizes the React framework and provides a user interface for interacting with the server-side functionalities. The client-side code is written in TypeScript, offering static typing and improved code maintainability.
- To run the client, navigate to the client folder and run the following commands:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
- This will start the Next.js development server and the client application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

### server
- The server folder contains the Node.js application that acts as the back-end for the client application. The server is implemented using TypeScript for enhanced reliability and maintainability.
- To run the server, navigate to the server folder and run the following commands:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
- This will start the Node.js development server and the server application will be accessible at http://localhost:4000.
